This study examines the ability of four European-scale ecosystem classifications to differentiate earthworm assemblages and derive typical assemblages for different ecosystem types. We combined two large-scale climatic classifications (Biogeographic Regions and Holdridge Life Zones) with two small-scale land cover classifications (CORINE Land Cover and European Nature Information System) to create four combined ecosystem classifications.
Our Key findings:

- Climate and land cover influence earthworm assemblages at varying spatial scales, but only weakly.    
- The Biogeographic Regions and CORINE Land Cover classification explained more variance in earthworm assemblage composition.    
- Typical earthworm assemblages were derived for each ecosystem type, but showed considerable overlap due to the dominance of a few widespread species.    
- The study highlights the challenges of using earthworms to characterize ecosystem types at a continental scale due to their low species richness and the prevalence of generalist species.    

The data we used is largely derived from the open accesses data bases [sWorm](https://idata.idiv.de/ddm/Data/ShowData/1818?version=15) and [edaphobase](https://portal.edaphobase.org/). Our data are available upon reasonable request. The code used for analysis and visualizations is provided in the folder 02_code.
